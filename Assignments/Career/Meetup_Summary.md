### Data Science Meetup Summary

Yesterday I went to a workshop on ML conducted by Dr. Sebastian Raschka and hosted by the MSU Data Science Club. Sebastian blitzed through the basics of regression and provided us with a jupyter notebook to follow along. Running through his code I discovered some useful tricks that he uses in his ML pipeline, such as using mlxtend to display the decision boundary for classification problems. His presentation was very math heavy, and I can tell a chunk of the audience was lost, but having learned about regression beforehand helped me understand the subject deeper than when I came in. Due to time constraints, I wasn't able to talk to Sebastian after the workshop. Still, I now know more than when I came in and will continue to take part in future events at MSUDS.
