## Problem
Predicting the outcomes of sporting events is a staple activity in sports that was more art than skill for a long time. It wasn't until the advent of Sports Analytics that the methodology behind sports prediction became quantified. With data becoming increasingly available to everyone, it's now possible for anyone to create a model to predict the outcomes of sports. 

The highly variant nature of college basketball presents an interesting case; the NCAA tournament is dubbed "March Madness" for a reason. [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/mens-machine-learning-competition-2018/leaderboard) hosts yearly competitions for predicting March Madness but very few models consistently perform well. Vegas and the Oddsmakers are still the gold standard in predicting sports and March Madness is no different. After all, if they weren't, they wouldn't be profitable. Like a small-school underdog facing a blue-blood powerhouse, this model seeks to answer the question: Can we beat the odds?

## Clients
### The Underdog Mid-Majors: Sports Betters
Enthusiastic sports betters would be highly interested in a model that gives them an edge over the house. A well-performing model could yield lucrative returns on betting in the long run.

### The Power Conference Staples: Sports Analytics Companies
Sports Analytics companies would be interested in this type of model as well. The companies are often contracted by actual sports teams looking to gain an edge over the competition through analytics.

### The Blue-Bloods: The Oddsmakers
If this model is found to consistently beat The Oddsmakers, then it would be in their best interest to maintain a house advantage over prospective betters.
